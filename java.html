<font color = "black">Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for portability and ease of use.
Java programs are compiled into bytecode that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)making them platform-independent — "Write Once, Run Anywhere".
Created by James Gosling in 1995; now maintained by Oracle Corporation.<hr><br>

<font color = "black">Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and now owned by Oracle. 
It is widely used for desktop applications, web applications, Android apps, enterprise systems, games, and cloud-based solutions.
 One of Java’s most notable features is platform independence — programs compiled into bytecode can run on any system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</P><hr><br>

<B> JAVA HISTORY </B><font color = "blue"><hr><br><P align = "center">
<font color = "black">The programming language Java was developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s.
 Initially the goal was to build a platform independent language for embedded devices such as set-top boxes and televisions.
After exploring C++ (which proved too heavy and too closely tied to platform dependencies), the team embarked on an entirely new project codenamed the “Green Project”.
